1. What is the Big O for this?
    1 - O(1)
    2 - O(n)

2. Even or odd - O(1) constant, it doesn't matter what the value of the input is, it takes the same amount of time to calulate a modulo.

3. Are you here? - O(n^k) polynomial time, O(n^2), 2 levels of looping.

4. Doubler - O(n) linear, basically sums by doubling, time increases as value goes higher in a linear fashion.

5. Naive search - O(n) linear, no method to the search, could be at the end of the array, gotta go through each in order.

6. Creating pairs - O(n^k) polynomial time, O(n^2), 2 levels of looping.

7. Compute the sequence - O(log(n)) logarithmic search,

8. An efficient search - O(log(n)) logarithmic search, sorted array that splits it in half at first decreasing time.

9. Random element - O(1) constant, same time no matter what the array is.
